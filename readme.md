# Blog Back

This is my personal blogger backend.

This project is just implement a simple logger with awesome
language (rust) and the awesome web framework (actix web).

After all functionality are finish, and refactor to my 
ideal project structure, I'll open source this project.

My goal is build an Ideal rust example project.

## TODO
- [ ] use SQLDatabase to all repository.
- [ ] refactor to use route attribute.
- [ ] refactor to use serde_json instead of json.

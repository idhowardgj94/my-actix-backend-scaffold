# Blog Back

## declaration

This is used to be my personal blog's backend service.

At that time, I write this backend just aim to famillar with rust lang and actix web framework.

I just plan that when I refactor this service idiom enough,

I'll public this project to offer my version of real world example.

but I'm recently busy, and have no effort to rafactor this repo.

so even there are still many part that not idiom enough,

I deside to public this repo. and just for myself to have a scaffold when i need to use rust to develop in the futrue.

I'll continuce refactor this code sometime in the futrue.

If you find this repo help you for kick start rust lang,

I'm glad.

happy coding.

After all functionality are finish, and refactor to my 
ideal project structure, I'll open source this project.

My goal is build an Ideal rust example project.
